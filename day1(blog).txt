1) Blog about HTTP1.1 and HTTP2.0

HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information and it has four versions - http0.9,http1.0,http1.1 and http2.0.
now we are going to discuss about http1.1 and  http2.0

HTTP1.0 - SIMPLE
HTTP1.1 - REUSE
HTTP2.0 - CONCURRENT

HTTP1.1

* The HTTP/1.1 standard was published only a few months after HTTP/1.0,yet a version change was necessary because many applications pronounced themselves “HTTP/1.0”,
but they were not fully implemented.
*http1.1 is are usable and editable

SLOW PAGE LOADS LEADS TO
*frustated Users
*High Bounce Rates

COMMON HTTP1.1
*Domain shrading
*Image sprites
*Concatenation/Minification

HTTP2.0

*The HTTP 2.0 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.HTTP2.0 is concurrent.

HTTP/2

*Compress HTTP Headers
*Allows Server Pushes
*Enables Multiplexing

Conclusion:
HTTP/1.1 has served as the backbone of web communication for a long time, but with the growing complexity of web applications, HTTP/2.0 emerged to address its limitations. By introducing features such as multiplexing, server push, and improved header compression, HTTP/2.0 significantly enhances web performance, resulting in faster page load times
